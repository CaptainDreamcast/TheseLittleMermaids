[OUTRO]
dummy: Triton saved his daughters and kept them from turning into foam.
dummy: They vowed to never go after icky human men again, which severely depresses icky human men like me who like to read doujinshi about mermaids.
dummy: However, one daughter went to a japanese prince and brought back forbidden knowledge. This led to Octopus men becoming incredibly popular among Triton's daughters.
dummy: He loves his daughters though, just like I love you for playing this game. Thanks for playing! The end!
