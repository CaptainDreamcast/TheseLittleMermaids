[final2]
dummy: And so, God flipping died and Ohio was saved. The cabbage took his place as the lord of all creation.
dummy: ""OH GOD, I AM HOLDING UP THE FABRIC OF REALITY!""
dummy: Wolf and goat opened a sweets/butcher shop together. Every day is a fight for survival.
dummy: As for you, you took part in the Ludum Dare 54 (but still with your iconic spiky hair and your iconic dragonslayer sword).
dummy: The moral of the story is, even when your means and space are limited the power of friendship and cabbage is unlimited.
dummy: end


[abandonment_ending]
dummy: You just sail away. What are they going to do? They don't have a boat.
dummy: Ultimately, you end up on a new continent you decide to call India (it's actually Europe).
dummy: Here, you meet the European God and- well you know how it goes from there.
dummy: end

[goat_dies_ending]
dummy: You don't make it far before hearing an alarmingly disturbing "The best goat snack wooooo!" coming from the shore you just left.
dummy: After turning around, you find the wolf fattened and out of shape... next to the goat? 
dummy: The goat made snacks for the wolf and now the wolf is too self-conscious to go out on boat rides and leaves for the gym instead.
dummy: end

[cabbage_dies_ending]
dummy: After returning to the shore you find the cabbage missing, only hearing a muffled "OH GOD, I'M FOOD" from the goat's stomach.
dummy: You decide to paint a rock green, but the rock is way too chipper and happy to pass as cabbage. [I'm absolutely fine and dandy being a rock, I'm halfway to rock and roll, matey]
dummy: Finally, you try to take a bite to prove to God that the rock is, in fact, cabbage, shattering your teeth.
dummy: end


[intro]
dummy: title
dummy: Long ago, in an ancient, more mystical time where reason was not as developed as it is now: That's right, August 2023. 
dummy: There lived...
dummy: YOU!
dummy: With your iconic spiky hair.
dummy: And your iconic six foot 11 dragonslayer sword.
dummy: You were walking the mean lean streets of Ohio, as you always do.
dummy: Suddenly, a shaggy, yet stylish, homeless man rises up from a trash can and proclaims himself to be God. 
dummy: "I will flood Ohio!", he proclaimed, picking cheeseburger pieces out of his beard.
dummy: ""You will carry three of my proudest creations out of this land on an arch. We're doing that again.""
dummy: ""In return, I will grant your greatest wish. I will make catgirls a reality.""
dummy: You agreed unconditionally.
